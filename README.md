# Interactive video chooser

This is an interactive tool to choose the next video to watch from a folder passed in as command line argument

First it shows the channels extracted from the video names.
The user can then choose one of the channels to watch a video from.
If the channel has only one video, this video is played directly.
If the channel has more than one video, the user can choose one of the videos or play them all in order.

After watching a video the user can choose to delete it and continue watching or to quit.

## CODEX

This repository was an experiment for writing code together with OpenAI's [CODEX API](https://openai.com/blog/openai-codex/).
During the development I only intervened through comments and regeneration.
This README was also mostly generated by appending `--- README.md ---` to the script and ask CODEX to complete it.

## Usage

```
python interactive_video_chooser.py /path/to/folder
```

This assumes videos to be named like `channel name<delimiter>rest of the filename.ext`.
The default delimiter is `_`.
You can change it by passing the `-d` or `--delimiter` flag.

## Feature Ideas

- Configure sort and play order
- Configure extensions (include and exclude)
- Change how many videos to play (per channel)
- Set if videos should be deleted after watching
- Set how long to wait before deleting videos
- Choose channels and videos to watch by entering multiple numbers
